# Research Methods - Cognitive-Computing  

> Research Methods in Computing and I.T. - 4th Year module  
> Taught by Dr Martin Kenirons  
> Give a presentation and write a literature review on a topic that is currently being researched in the computing and I.T. industry.  

For the presentation and literature review required for this module I have decided my topic will be Cognitive Computing. I have a keen intrest in the "learning" side computers. I chose this topic because I find it very interesting and I really enjoyed delving into the research that has been completed and is still under way for this topic. The more I learn about cognitive computing the more excited I am for the future to see how these systems will help or hinder the world.
